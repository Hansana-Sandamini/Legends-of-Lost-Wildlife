                    <p>The <strong>Hawaiian Poi Dog</strong> was a unique breed of pariah dog that was brought to Hawaii by Polynesian settlers around 300-800 AD. This small to medium-sized dog was bred specifically for food production and religious ceremonies in ancient Hawaiian culture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Named after poi, the traditional Hawaiian staple food made from taro root, these dogs were intentionally fattened on a vegetarian diet of poi and other starches. Their meat was considered a delicacy and was reserved for royalty and special occasions. The breed became extinct in the late 19th century due to interbreeding with imported dogs and changing cultural practices.</p>
                    
                    <p>Poi dogs played an important role in Hawaiian society beyond just food. They were considered spiritual protectors and were sometimes sacrificed in religious ceremonies. Their bones were used to make fishhooks and other tools, and their skins were used for drum coverings.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The Hawaiian Poi Dog had several distinctive features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Small to medium, standing about 35-45 cm (14-18 in) at the shoulder</li>
                        <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 15-25 kg (33-55 lbs) when fully grown</li>
                        <li><strong>Coat:</strong> Short and coarse, typically brown or black</li>
                        <li><strong>Head:</strong> Broad and flat with a short muzzle</li>
                        <li><strong>Tail:</strong> Short and often curled</li>
                        <li><strong>Legs:</strong> Short and stout due to the starchy diet</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The breed's most notable feature was its barrel-shaped body, resulting from the high-carbohydrate diet it was fed. This gave the dogs a distinctive pot-bellied appearance unlike any other dog breed.</p>

            <h2>üå∫ Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>The Poi Dog held a unique place in traditional Hawaiian culture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Considered a sacred animal associated with the god K≈´</li>
                <li>Used in religious ceremonies and sacrifices</li>
                <li>Meat reserved for ali'i (Hawaiian royalty) and special feasts</li>
                <li>Bones used to make tools and fishhooks</li>
                <li>Skins used to cover pahu (ceremonial drums)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dogs were often kept in special pens and fed a diet of poi (mashed taro root), sweet potatoes, and other starches to fatten them up. This vegetarian diet gave their meat a distinctive flavor different from meat-eating dogs.</p>

            <h2>‚è≥ Extinction Causes</h2>
            <p>The disappearance of the Poi Dog resulted from several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural changes:</strong> Decline in traditional Hawaiian practices after Western contact</li>
                <li><strong>Interbreeding:</strong> Mixing with European dog breeds introduced in the 18th-19th centuries</li>
                <li><strong>Disease:</strong> Vulnerability to foreign canine diseases</li>
                <li><strong>Changing diets:</strong> Western influence reduced demand for dog meat</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last purebred Poi Dogs disappeared by the late 1800s, though some modern Hawaiian mutts may carry traces of their ancestry.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>English White Terrier</strong> was a breed of small, all-white terrier that existed in Britain during the 19th century. Developed as a show dog and companion animal, this breed is notable for being one of the foundation breeds for many modern terriers, including the Boston Terrier and the Bull Terrier.</p>
                    
                    <p>First recognized in the 1860s, the English White Terrier was bred to be an elegant companion dog with pure white coat and distinctive rose or button ears. Despite its popularity in dog shows, the breed was plagued by genetic health problems and fell out of favor by the 1890s. The last known specimens died in the early 20th century.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, the English White Terrier is remembered primarily through historical records and its influence on modern breeds. Its genetic legacy lives on in several popular terrier breeds that descended from it.</p>

            <h2>üíî Extinction Causes</h2>
            <p>The breed's disappearance resulted from several factors:</p>
            <ul>

                    <p>The <strong>Moscow Water Dog</strong> (also known as the Moscow Diver) was a Soviet-era working breed developed in the 1940s-1950s for water rescue operations. Created by the Red Star Kennels, this large, powerful dog was intended to be the USSR's answer to breeds like the Newfoundland and Portuguese Water Dog.</p>
                    
                    <p>The breed was developed by crossing Newfoundlands, Caucasian Shepherds, and East European Shepherds. While initially successful, the project was abandoned in the late 1950s when most of the dogs proved too aggressive for water rescue work. Some specimens were incorporated into the breeding program that eventually produced the Black Russian Terrier.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, the Moscow Water Dog is remembered as an ambitious but ultimately failed Soviet breeding experiment. Its brief existence provides interesting insights into the state-controlled dog breeding programs of the USSR.</p>

                    <p>The Moscow Water Dog was an imposing working breed:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The breed was specifically designed for cold water rescue, with webbed feet and a dense undercoat to protect against frigid temperatures. Its large size and strength allowed it to pull drowning victims to safety.</p>

            <h2>‚öíÔ∏è Working Role</h2>

                <li>Water rescue operations in rivers and coastal areas</li>
                <li>Retrieving objects from water</li>

                <li>Potential military applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite these ambitious goals, most dogs proved unsuitable for rescue work due to their unpredictable temperament inherited from the Caucasian Shepherd lineage.</p>

            <h2>üõë Program Cancellation</h2>
            <p>The breeding program was discontinued due to several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperament issues:</strong> Many dogs were too aggressive for rescue work</li>
                <li><strong>Training difficulties:</strong> Hard to control in water rescue scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Expensive to maintain the breeding program</li>
                <li><strong>Changing priorities:</strong> Shift in Soviet military/rescue needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last pure Moscow Water Dogs disappeared in the 1960s, though some of their genes live on in the Black Russian Terrier.</p>
