            <p>
                Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by their fur or hair and the ability to nurse their young with milk. Throughout Earth's history, 
                numerous mammal species have gone extinct due to climate change, human activity, and other ecological factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the most fascinating extinct mammals include massive Ice Age creatures like woolly mammoths, giant ground sloths, and saber-toothed cats. 
                More recent extinctions include species like the Tasmanian tiger and the Caribbean monk seal.
            </p>
            <p>
                These extinctions represent not just the loss of individual species, but the disappearance of unique evolutionary adaptations and ecological 
                relationships. Below we highlight some of the most remarkable extinct mammals from different periods of Earth's history.

                        An Ice Age giant that roamed the tundras over 4,000 years ago. Known for their long, curved tusks and thick fur coats adapted to cold 
                        environments.
