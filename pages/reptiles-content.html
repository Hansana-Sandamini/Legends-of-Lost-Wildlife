                    <p>The <strong>Floreana Island Giant Tortoise</strong> was a subspecies of Gal√°pagos tortoise endemic to Floreana Island in the Gal√°pagos archipelago. These massive reptiles could reach over 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and weigh up to 400 kg (880 lbs), making them among the largest tortoises to ever exist.</p>
                    
                    <p>First documented by Charles Darwin during his visit in 1835, the tortoises were already rare due to exploitation by whalers and pirates who used them as a source of fresh meat on long voyages. The last known purebred individual died in captivity in 1852, though recent genetic studies have revealed hybrid descendants on other islands.</p>
                    
                    <p>These tortoises played a crucial ecological role as "ecosystem engineers," shaping vegetation patterns through their grazing and dispersing seeds across the island. Their extinction dramatically altered Floreana's ecosystem.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The Floreana tortoise had several distinctive features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Up to 1.5 m (5 ft) long and 400 kg (880 lbs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Shell:</strong> Saddleback shape allowing greater neck extension</li>
                        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Potentially over 150 years in the wild</li>
                        <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Herbivorous - cacti, grasses, fruits and leaves</li>
                        <li><strong>Water storage:</strong> Could survive months without fresh water</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The saddleback shell shape was an adaptation to reach higher vegetation in Floreana's drier environment. Their slow metabolism allowed them to survive long periods without food or water - an advantage that ironically made them ideal "living provisions" for sailors.</p>

            <h2>üèùÔ∏è Habitat & Ecology</h2>
            <p>The tortoises thrived in Floreana's unique ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volcanic island with diverse microclimates</li>
                <li>Dry lowlands with sparse vegetation</li>
                <li>Higher elevation areas with lush vegetation</li>
                <li>Seasonal migration between elevations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As keystone species, they created "tortoise highways" - cleared paths through vegetation used by other animals. Their grazing maintained open areas and their droppings fertilized the soil.</p>

            <h2>‚è≥ Extinction Causes</h2>
            <p>The subspecies was driven to extinction by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overharvesting:</strong> Taken by whalers (estimated 200,000 removed)</li>
                <li><strong>Introduced species:</strong> Rats, pigs and dogs destroyed eggs/hatchlings</li>
                <li><strong>Habitat alteration:</strong> Human settlement and agriculture</li>
                <li><strong>Limited range:</strong> Only existed on one small island</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last purebred died just 17 years after Darwin's visit, though conservationists have identified hybrids with tortoise DNA from other islands that may allow partial restoration of the lineage.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Current initiatives include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetic identification:</strong> Finding hybrids with Floreana ancestry</li>
                        <li><strong>Breeding programs:</strong> Attempting to "breed back" the subspecies</li>
                        <li><strong>Habitat restoration:</strong> Removing invasive species from Floreana</li>
                        <li><strong>Rewilding plans:</strong> Potential reintroduction of similar tortoises</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In 2015, 19 tortoises with partial Floreana ancestry were identified on Isabela Island and moved to a breeding center, offering hope for partial restoration of this lost subspecies.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Caribbean Monk Seal</strong> was the only seal species native to the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Growing to 2-2.4 meters (6.5-8 feet) long and weighing 160-270 kg (350-600 lbs), this marine mammal was the first New World mammal documented by Columbus in 1494, and the first seal species to go extinct due to human activities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once abundant throughout the Caribbean, the species declined rapidly due to hunting for its blubber (used for oil) and overfishing of its food sources. The last confirmed sighting was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank between Jamaica and Nicaragua, though unverified reports persisted into the 1970s.</p>
                    
                    <p>This seal played an important role in Caribbean ecosystems as both predator and prey, maintaining fish populations and providing food for sharks. Its extinction represents a significant loss of marine biodiversity in the region.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Unlike cold-water seals, it had a thinner blubber layer adapted to tropical waters. Historical accounts describe it as particularly sluggish on land, making it easy prey for hunters.</p>

            <h2>üèùÔ∏è Habitat & Distribution</h2>
            <p>The seal's range included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Throughout the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico</li>
                <li>Coastal areas, coral reefs and atolls</li>
                <li>Remote islands for breeding and resting</li>
                <li>Warm tropical waters (20-25¬∞C/68-77¬∞F)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They preferred areas with abundant fish populations and secluded beaches for hauling out. Major colonies existed in the Bahamas, Yucat√°n Peninsula, and Lesser Antilles before hunting decimated them.</p>

            <h2>üíÄ Extinction Timeline</h2>
            <p>The species' decline followed this tragic pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1494:</strong> First documented by Columbus (immediately hunted)</li>
                <li><strong>1700s:</strong> Systematic hunting for oil begins</li>
                <li><strong>1850s:</strong> Already rare throughout most of range</li>
                <li><strong>1900s:</strong> Only a few small colonies remain</li>
                <li><strong>1952:</strong> Last confirmed sighting</li>
                <li><strong>2008:</strong> Officially declared extinct</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The combination of overhunting and destruction of its coastal habitat proved impossible for the species to overcome.</p>

            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The seal's extinction affected Caribbean ecosystems by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removing a key predator of reef fish and crustaceans</li>
                        <li>Eliminating a food source for large sharks</li>
                        <li>Disrupting nutrient cycling in coastal areas</li>
                        <li>Creating an "empty niche" in marine food webs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Scientists speculate that some coral reef declines may be indirectly linked to the loss of this important predator that helped maintain balanced fish populations.</p>
