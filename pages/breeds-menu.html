            <p>
                Throughout history, numerous dog breeds have disappeared due to changing human needs, lack of breeding programs, or being absorbed into other 
                breeds. These extinct breeds each had unique characteristics and served specific purposes in human societies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many extinct breeds were working dogs that became obsolete as technology advanced, while others fell out of fashion or were victims of war and 
                social changes. Their legacy lives on in modern breeds that carry fragments of their DNA.
            </p>
            <p>
                The breeds featured here represent just a few examples of dogs that once played important roles in human civilization but are now lost to history. 
                Their stories remind us of the rich diversity of canine evolution and our shared history with dogs.

                    <p>
                        An ancient Polynesian breed brought to Hawaii by early settlers. These small, pot-bellied dogs were fed a vegetarian diet of poi 
                        (taro paste), making their meat tender. They became extinct in the late 19th century due to interbreeding with imported dogs and cultural 
                        changes.

                    <p>
                        Developed in 1860s England as a show breed, this all-white terrier had distinctive folded ears. Plagued by genetic health issues and 
                        deafness, the breed disappeared by the early 20th century. It contributed to the development of the Boston Terrier and Bull Terrier.

                        A Soviet-era working breed created in the 1950s by crossing Newfoundlands with German Shepherds. Intended for water rescue, the project was 
                        abandoned when the dogs showed more interest in biting than rescuing. Some bloodlines contributed to the Black Russian Terrier.
