                    <h2>What Does Extinction Mean</h2>
                    <p>
                        An animal is considered extinct when the last remaining member of its species dies out and there is not a single individual left on Earth. Causes of 
                        extinction might include an epidemic, extreme climate changes, loss of food sources, and destruction of their natural habitats. When a large number of 
                        species goes out of existence in some major calamity, it is called an extinction event.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Out of all the extinction events witnessed by the Earth since it first came into existence, the 'Big Five' extinction events have been the most crucial 
                        in making the world the way it is today. These major extinction events have caused gigantic animals like dinosaurs, mammoths, and giant sloths to go out 
                        of existence, while certain birds and smaller animals like the dodo and golden toad could not survive either.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current rate of extinction is estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than the natural background rate. Human activities such as deforestation, pollution, overhunting, and climate change are driving this accelerated loss of biodiversity. Unlike prehistoric mass extinctions caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions, the current crisis is directly attributable to human influence on the planet's ecosystems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the most tragic extinction stories involve species that disappeared just as science was beginning to understand them. The thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, was declared extinct in 1936, just 59 days after the last known individual died in captivity. The Caribbean monk seal vanished in the 1950s before proper studies could be conducted. These losses represent not just the disappearance of species, but the permanent loss of unique genetic information and ecological relationships that took millions of years to evolve.

            <h3>Notable Extinctions in Recent History</h3>
            <p>
                The 20th century alone saw the disappearance of many remarkable species. The passenger pigeon, once so numerous that flocks would darken the sky for days, went extinct in 1914 due to relentless hunting and habitat destruction. The Japanese sea lion, last seen in the 1950s, fell victim to commercial fishing and targeted hunting. More recently, the western black rhino was declared extinct in 2011 after years of poaching for its valuable horn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marine species have not been spared either. The great auk, a flightless seabird, was hunted to extinction by 1844. The Caribbean monk seal disappeared in the 1950s due to overhunting. Even freshwater ecosystems have suffered losses - the Chinese paddlefish, one of the world's largest freshwater fish, was declared extinct in 2020 after dam construction blocked its migratory routes.
